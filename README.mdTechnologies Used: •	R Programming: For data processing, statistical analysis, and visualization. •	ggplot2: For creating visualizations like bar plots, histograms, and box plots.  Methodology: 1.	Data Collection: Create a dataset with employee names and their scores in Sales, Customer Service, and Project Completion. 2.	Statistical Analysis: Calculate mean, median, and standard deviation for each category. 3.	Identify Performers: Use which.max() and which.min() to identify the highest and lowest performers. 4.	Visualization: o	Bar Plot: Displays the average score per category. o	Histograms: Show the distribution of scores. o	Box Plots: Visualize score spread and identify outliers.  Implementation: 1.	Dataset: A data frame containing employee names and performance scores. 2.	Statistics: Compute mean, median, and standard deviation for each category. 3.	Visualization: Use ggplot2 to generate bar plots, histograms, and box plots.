Technologies Used:
•	R Programming: For data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.
•	ggplot2: For creating visualizations like bar plots, histograms, and box plots.

Methodology:
1.	Data Collection: Create a dataset with employee names and their scores in Sales, Customer Service, and Project Completion.
2.	Statistical Analysis: Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for each category.
3.	Identify Performers: Use which.max() and which.min() to identify the highest and lowest performers.
4.	Visualization:
o	Bar Plot: Displays the average score per category.
o	Histograms: Show the distribution of scores.
o	Box Plots: Visualize score spread and identify outliers.

Implementation:
1.	Dataset: A data frame containing employee names and performance scores.
2.	Statistics: Compute mean, median, and standard deviation for each category.
3.	Visualization: Use ggplot2 to generate bar plots, histograms, and box plots.
